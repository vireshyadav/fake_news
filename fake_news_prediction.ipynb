    "There are more than millions of news contents published on the internet every day. If we include the tweets from twitter, then this figure will be increased in multiples. Nowadays, the internet is becoming the biggest source of spreading fake news. A mechanism is required to identify fake news published on the internet so that the readers can be warned accordingly. Some researchers have proposed the methods to identify fake news by analyzing the text data of the news based on the machine learning techniques. Here, we will also discuss the machine learning techniques that can identify fake news correctly.\n",

    "The dataset used in this article is taken from Kaggle that is publically available as the Fake and real news dataset. This data set has two CSV files containing true and fake news. Each having Title, text, subject and date attributes. There are 21417 true news data and 23481 fake news data given in the true and fake CSV files respectively. To train the model for classification, we will add a column in both the datasets as real or fake. \n",

First, we will obtain the term frequencies and count vectorizer that will be included as input attributes for the classification model and the target attribute that we have defined above will work as the output attribute. To bind the count vectorizer, TF-IDF and classification model together, the concept of the pipeline is used. A machine learning pipeline is used to help automate machine learning workflows. They operate by enabling a sequence of data to be transformed and correlated together in a model that can be tested and evaluated to achieve an outcome, whether positive or negative.\n",
